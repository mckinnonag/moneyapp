<h1>Money App<h1>

A web application with a React frontend and a Go backend which allows users to connect multiple bank accounts, view transactions, and split those transactions with other users.

The app uses the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/docs/api/) to connect with banking institutions.

This is still a work in progress.

Todo:

* Finish transaction-sharing functionality

* Clean up CSS

* Testing

* Replace home-grown auth with Firebase
