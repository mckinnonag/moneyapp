# Money App

A web application with a React frontend and a Go backend which allows users to connect multiple bank accounts, view transactions, and split those transactions with other users.

The app uses the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/docs/api/) to connect with banking institutions.

This is still a work in progress.

<ul>
    <li>Finish transaction-sharing functionality</li>
    <li>Clean up CSS</li>
    <li>Testing</li>
    <li>Replace home-grown auth with Firebase</li>
</ul>
