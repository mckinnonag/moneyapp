# Money App

A web application with a React frontend and a Go backend which allows users to connect multiple bank accounts, view transactions, and split those transactions with other users.

The app uses the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/docs/api/) to connect with banking institutions, and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for auth and user management.

This is still a work in progress!
